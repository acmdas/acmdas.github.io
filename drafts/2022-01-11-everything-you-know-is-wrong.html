<p>
This was one of my mantras, long before I had heard the word “mantra”.
</p>

<p>
I was one of those insufferable school kids who was always reading ahead, reading outside of the textbook, quietly bored in class.
</p>

<p>
I was inspired to become a spaceman (before we’d heard that they were called “astronauts”) by Tom Corbet books and on TV, to be a paleontologist by Roy Chapman Andrews’ “All About Dinosaurs”, to be an archaeologist by “All About Prehistoric Cave Men” and to be a geologist by “All About Our Changing Rocks”.
</p>

<p>
Anne Terry White’s “All About Our Changing Rocks” was to prove my downfall, leading me to become one of those people who “question authority” before that became a bumper sticker. It’s not her fault, not directly. What she wrote in 1955 (and I read when I was eight) was innocent enough. Igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, erosion, crust and mantle were all innocent enough words and she presented them accurately.
</p>

<p>
Her role in my demise was to make them so interesting that, in sixth grade, I found a Geology 101 textbook and read it cover to cover.
</p>
