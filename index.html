O GOD, who didst will that thy Word should take flesh in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary at the message of an Angel; grant that we thy supplicants, who believe her to be in truth the Mother of God, may be holpen by her intercessions before thee. Through the same Jesus Christ our Lord, <i>AMEN</i>.

ALMIGHTY Father, who hast given thine only Son to die for our sins, and to rise again for our justification; Grant us so to put away the leaven of malice and wickedness, that we may always serve thee in pureness of living and truth; through the merits of the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. <i>Amen</i>.
