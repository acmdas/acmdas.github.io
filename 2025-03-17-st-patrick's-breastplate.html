<p>
I arise today<br>
Through a mighty strength, the invocation of the Trinity,<br>
Through belief in the Threeness,<br>
Through confession of the Oneness<br>
of the Creator of creation.<br>
</p>

<p>
I arise today<br>
Through the strength of Christ’s birth with His baptism,<br>
Through the strength of His crucifixion with His burial,<br>
Through the strength of His resurrection with His ascension,<br>
Through the strength of His descent for the judgment of doom.<br>
</p>

<p>
I arise today<br>
Through the strength of the love of cherubim,<br>
In the obedience of angels,<br>
In the service of archangels,<br>
In the hope of resurrection to meet with reward,<br>
In the prayers of patriarchs,<br>
In the predictions of prophets,<br>
In the preaching of apostles,<br>
In the faith of confessors,<br>
In the innocence of holy virgins,<br>
In the deeds of righteous men.<br>
</p>

<p>
I arise today, through<br>
The strength of heaven,<br>
The light of the sun,<br>
The radiance of the moon,<br>
The splendor of fire,<br>
The speed of lightning,<br>
The swiftness of wind,<br>
The depth of the sea,<br>
The stability of the earth,<br>
The firmness of rock.<br>
</p>

<p>
I arise today, through<br>
God’s strength to pilot me,<br>
God’s might to uphold me,<br>
God’s wisdom to guide me,<br>
God’s eye to look before me,<br>
God’s ear to hear me,<br>
God’s word to speak for me,<br>
God’s hand to guard me,<br>
God’s shield to protect me,<br>
God’s host to save me<br>
From snares of devils,<br>
From temptation of vices,<br>
From everyone who shall wish<br> me ill,
afar and near.<br>
</p>

<p>
I summon today<br>
All these powers between me and those evils,<br>
Against every cruel and merciless power<br>
that may oppose my body and soul,<br>
Against incantations of false prophets,<br>
Against black laws of pagandom,<br>
Against false laws of heretics,<br>
Against craft of idolatry,<br>
Against spells of witches and smiths and wizards,<br>
Against every knowledge that corrupts man’s body and soul;<br>
Christ to shield me today<br>
Against poison, against burning,<br>
Against drowning, against wounding,<br>
So that there may come to me an abundance of reward.<br>
</p>

<p>
Christ with me,<br>
Christ before me,<br>
Christ behind me,<br>
Christ in me,<br>
Christ beneath me,<br>
Christ above me,<br>
Christ on my right,<br>
Christ on my left,<br>
Christ when I lie down,<br>
Christ when I sit down,<br>
Christ when I arise,<br>
Christ in the heart of every man who thinks of me,<br>
Christ in the mouth of everyone who speaks of me,<br>
Christ in every eye that sees me,<br>
Christ in every ear that hears me.<br>
</p>

<p>
I arise today<br>
Through a mighty strength, the invocation of the Trinity,<br>
Through belief in the Threeness,<br>
Through confession of the Oneness<br>
of the Creator of creation.
