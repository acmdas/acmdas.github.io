GRANT to us, Lord, we beseech thee, the spirit to think and do always such things as are right; that we, who cannot do any thing that is good without thee, may by thee be entitled to live according to thy will; through Jesus Christ our lord. /Amen/.

The Season is Trinity, the Liturgical Color is Green.
