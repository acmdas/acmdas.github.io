O God, who makest us glad by the yearly solemnity of our Lord’s Resurrection: mercifully grant,that in keeping of these temporal feasts, we may hereafter attain to the joys of everlasting life. Through the same, our Lord Jesus Christ. /Amen/.

The Season is Eastertide, the Liturgical Color is White.

Note: /This collect is not found in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. It is taken from the American “The Anglican Office Book” originally developed by Fr Paul Hartzell in 1944. Text found there which is not found in the American Book of Common Prayer (1928) or the British Book of Common Prayer (1662) is presumably based on one of the versions of the Sarum Rite or some other pre-Protestant form/.
