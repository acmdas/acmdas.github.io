O GOD, the Creator and Redeemer of all them that believe, grant unto the souls of thy servants and handmaids the remission of all their sins: that through devout supplications they may obtain the pardon they have always desired, Who livest and reignest with thee, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, one God, world without end. /Amen/.

The Season is Trinity, the Liturgical Color is /White/.
