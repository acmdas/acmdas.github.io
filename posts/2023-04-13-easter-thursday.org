O GOD, who hast knit together divers nations in the one confession of thy Name: grant that they who have been born again in the font of Baptism, may likewise be one in inward faith and holiness of conversation. Through the same our Lord Jesus Christ. /Amen/.

The Season is Eastertide, the Liturgical Color is White.
