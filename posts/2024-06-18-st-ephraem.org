O GOD, who didst will to illumine thy Church with the wonderful learning and splendid merits of blessed Ephrem thy Confessor and Doctor: we humbly beseech thee, at his intercession, that thou wouldest ever defend it by thy continual power against the snares of error and wickedness. Through Hesus Christ thy Son our Lord. Who liveth and reigneth with thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost, ever one God. World without end. /Amen/
