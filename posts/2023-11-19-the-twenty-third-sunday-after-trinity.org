O LORD, we beseech thee, absolve thy people from their offences; that through thy bountiful goodness we may all be delivered from the bands of those sins, which by our frailty we have committed. Grant this, O heavenly Father, for the sake of Jesus Christ, our blessed Lord and Saviour. /Amen/.

The Season is Trinity, the Liturgical Color is Green.

The Second Sunday before Advent!
