 O LORD, we beseech thee mercifully to receive the prayers of thy people who call upon thee; and grant that they may both perceive and know what things they ought to do, and also may have grace and power faithfully to fulfil the same; through Jesus Christ our Lord. /Amen/.

The Season is Epiphany, within the Octave of Epiphany. The liturgical color of the day is /White/.
