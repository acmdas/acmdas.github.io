O GOD, whose miracles of old we perceive to shine forth even in our own time to the glory and praise of thy Name, and to the honour of thine holy Confessor and Bishop Osmond: mercifully grant, that we who keep his festival may by his prayers both glorify thee in this present world, and be accounted worthy to enjoy thee in the world to come. Through Jesus Christ thy Son our Lord. Who liveth and reigneth with thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost, ever one God. World without end. /Amen/.

The Season is Trinity, the Liturgical Color is /Green/.
