O God, who didst lead the Blessed Virgin Mary to visit Elizabeth, to their exceeding joy and comfort: Grant unto thy people, that as Mary did rejoice to be called the Mother of the Lord, so they may ever rejoice to believe the incarnation of thine only-begotten Son; to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost be all honour and glory, world without end. /Amen/.
