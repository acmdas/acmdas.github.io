O God, whose never-failing providence ordereth all things both in heaven and earth; We humbly beseech thee to put away from us all hurtful things, and to give us those things which are profitable for us; through Jesus Christ our Lord. /Amen/.

The Season is Trinity, the Liturgical Color is /Green/.
