O GOD, who makest us glad with the yearly feast of blessed Edward, thy Confessor: mercifully grant, that, as we now observe his heavenly birthday, so we may follow him in all virtuous and godly living. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever. /Amen/.

The Season is Trinity, the Liturgical Color is /Red/.

860 years ago, the body of Edward, King of England 1042-66, were removed from his grave before the high altar of Westminster Abbey to a separate shrine befitting his status as a Saint Confessor of the Faith.
