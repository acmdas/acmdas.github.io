ALMIGHTY, everlasting God, who hast conferred the Paschal Mystery upon mankind for a covenant of reconciliation: grant unto our souls that what we celebrate with our lips, we may effectually show forth in our lives. Through the same our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

The Season is Eastertide, the Liturgical Color is White.
