Those with SPIRITUAL AVARICE will be found to be discontented with the spirituality which God gives them; and they are very disconsolate and querulous because they find not in spiritual things the consolation that they would desire.  They spend their time on [learning of spiritual matters] rather than on works of mortification and the perfecting of the inward poverty of spirit which should be theirs. They burden themselves with images and rosaries which are very curious... they want this kind of thing, now that, because it is more curious. And others you will see adorned with relics and tokens, like children with trinkets.

St John of the Cross, /Dark Night of the Soul/, Bk I, Ch III, i.
