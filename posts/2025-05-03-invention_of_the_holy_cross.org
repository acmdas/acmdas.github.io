O GOD, who in the finding of the Cross of our Salvation didst renew the wonders of thy passion: vouchsafe to grant that through the ransom once paid upon that Tree of life, we may attain unto life eternal. Who livest and reignest with the Father. /Amen/.

ALMIGHTY Father, who hast given thine only Son to die for our sins, and to rise again for our justification; Grant us so to put away the leaven of malice and wickedness, that we may always serve thee in pureness of living and truth; through the merits of the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. /Amen/.

The Season is Eastertide, the Liturgical Color is /Red/.
