O GOD, who didst vouchsafe to give blessed Augustine thy Bishop to be the first teacher of the English people; grant, we beseech thee, that we who on earth proclaim his merits, may inwardly percieve the benefit of his prayers for us on high. Through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. /Amen/.

The Season is Eastertide, the Liturgical Color is /White/.
