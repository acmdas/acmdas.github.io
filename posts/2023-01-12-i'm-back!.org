Yes, I’m back - yes, I know it’s been close to a year. There is a reason—actually several reasons over and above my tendancy to put things off. There will be some explanation and some catch-up, but not today. Not that long ago I reinstalled my accustomed OS, rebuilt emacs and rewrote my init.el, and am today getting some gitting caught up. So, the test I’m referring to is whether org-static-blog is dtrt, whether I can push to gist. Typing is hard with fingers crossed, so that’s it for now.
