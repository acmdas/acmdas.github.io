The Sunday Called Sexagesima, or the Second Sunday before Lent

O Lord God, who seest that we put not our trust in any thing that we do; Mercifully grant that by thy power we may be defended against all adversity; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

The Season is pre-Lent, the liturgical color is Purple.
