  Lie \Lie\ (l[imac]), n. [AS. lyge; akin to D. leugen, OHG. lugi,
     G. l["u]ge, lug, Icel. lygi, Dan. & Sw. l["o]gn, Goth. liugn.
     See {Lie} to utter a falsehood.]
     1. A falsehood uttered or acted for the purpose of deception;
        an intentional violation of truth; an untruth spoken with
        the intention to deceive.
              The proper notion of a lie is an endeavoring to
              deceive another by signifying that to him as true,
              which we ourselves think not to be so. --S. Clarke.
  
              It is willful deceit that makes a lie. A man may act
              a lie, as by pointing his finger in a wrong
              direction when a traveler inquires of him his road.
                                                    --Paley.
     2. A fiction; a fable; an untruth. --Dryden.
  
     3. Anything which misleads or disappoints.
  
              Wishing this lie of life was o'er.    --Trench.
  
     {To give the lie to}.
        (a) To charge with falsehood; as, the man gave him the
            lie.
        (b) To reveal to be false; as, a man's actions may give
            the lie to his words.

     {White lie}, a euphemism for such lies as one finds it
        convenient to tell, and excuses himself for telling.
  
     Syn: Untruth; falsehood; fiction; deception.
  
     Usage: {Lie}, {Untruth}. A man may state what is untrue from
            ignorance or misconception; hence, to impute an
            untruth to one is not necessarily the same as charging
            him with a lie. Every lie is an untruth, but not every
            untruth is a lie. Cf. {Falsity}.
