<p>
The Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ
</p>

<p>
The Twenty-fifth Day of December,
</p>

<p>
when ages beyond number had run their course from the creation of the world,
</p>

<p>
when God in the beginning created heaven and earth, and formed man in his own likeness;
</p>

<p>
when century upon century had passed since the Almighty set his bow in the clouds after the Great Flood, as a sign of covenant and peace;
</p>

<p>
in the twenty-first century since Abraham, our father in faith, came out of Ur of the Chaldees;
</p>

<p>
in the thirteenth century since the People of Israel were led by Moses in the Exodus from Egypt;
</p>

<p>
around the thousandth year since David was anointed King;
</p>

<p>
in the sixty-fifth week of the prophecy of Daniel;
</p>

<p>
in the one hundred and ninety-fourth Olympiad;
</p>

<p>
in the year seven hundred and fifty-two since the foundation of the City of Rome;
</p>

<p>
in the forty-second year of the reign of Caesar Octavian Augustus, the whole world being at peace,
</p>

<p>
JESUS CHRIST, eternal God and Son of the eternal Father, desiring to consecrate the world by his most loving presence, was conceived by the Holy Spirit, and when nine months had passed since his conception, was born of the Virgin Mary in Bethlehem of Judah, and was made man:
</p>

<p>
The Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ according to the flesh.

  <title><![CDATA[In the latter times some shall depart]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
“Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.” I Timothy 4: 1-3
</p>

<p>
Found in the second reading at Matins, and which brought me up short for a moment. Of course, now is surely not the first time after St Timothy read this that those words could describe the situation of the surrounding culture, or even the condition of Christ’s Church, but it certainly seems to describe recont conditions, Marriage certainly is declining, even among those who cohabit, and there seem to be more, at least in G20 countries, who are choosing (or finding themselves) unable or unwilling to cohabit, and even among those who marry fewer are willing to “go forth and multiply”. Perhaps it is “commanding to abstain from meats” that first struck me, with the talk, by the WEF and the Green religionists, that we will eat no real meat lest we destroy the Earth. All of which throws me back the CSL’s <i>That Hideous Strength</i> and the ever clearer vision of demons leading humans around by the nose. And of course we are told that no man knows, inclusing CSL and me. So that’s that.

  <title><![CDATA[Our Lady of Walsingham]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
O GOD, who in the Blessed Virgin Mary didst make a fit dwelling-place for thy Son: grant, we beseech thee, that we who honour her shrine at Walsingham may also become temples of thy Holy Ghost. Through the same Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the same Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without end. <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
Sing the praises of Mary, the Mother of God,
Whose Walsingham Way countless pilgrims have trod.
</p>

<p>
The Season is Trinity, the Liturgical Color is Red. 
</p>

<p>
The Shrine of Our Lady at Walsingham was established around 1061 when, according to the text of the Pynson Ballad (c 1485), Richeldis de Faverches prayed that she might undertake some special work in honour of Our Lady.
</p>

<p>
“ <i>Our Lady led Richeldis in spirit to Nazareth and showed her the house where the angel had greeted her. ‘Look, daughter’ said Our Lady. ‘Take the measurements of this house and erect another one like it in Walsingham, dedicated to praising and honouring me. All who come there shall find help in their need.</i>
</p>

<p>
“ <i>It shall be a perpetual memorial to the great joy of the Annunciation, ground and origin of all my joys and the root of humanity’s gracious Redemption. This came about through Gabriel’s message that I would be a mother through my humility, and conceive God’s Son in virginity.”  (Pynson Ballad 1485)</i>
</p>

<p>
The Lady Richeldis was a holy woman with a great love of the Mother of God. She asked Our Lady for a way to honour her, and it was from this desire in her heart that the events of Walsingham unfolded. Richeldis was not a visionary like the children in Lourdes and Fatima. She was a woman of faith, she pondered, meditated and prayed. In answer to her prayer, the Virgin Mary led her in spirit to Nazareth, showed her the House of the Annunciation where the Angel greeted Mary, and asked her to build a replica in Walsingham as a perpetual memorial of the Annunciation.
</p>

<p>
This Holy House was built and a religious community took charge of the foundation. Although we have very little historical material from this period, we know that with papal approval the Augustinian Canons built a Priory (c 1150). Walsingham became one of the greatest Shrines in Medieval Christendom.
