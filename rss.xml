  <title><![CDATA[I John 4]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.
</p>

<p>
Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them. We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
</p>

<p>
Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
</p>

<p>
Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.
</p>

<p>
Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.
</p>

<p>
There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. We love him, because he first loved us. If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.

  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
I am leading you along a way that is uniquely right for you. The closer to Me you grow, the more fully you become your true self—the one I designed you to be. Because you are one of a kind, the path you are traveling with Me diverges increasingly from that of other people. However, in My mysterious wisdom and ways, I enable you to follow this solitary path while staying in close contact with others. In fact, the more completely you devote yourself to Me, the more freely you can love people.
</p>

<p>
Marvel at the beauty of a life intertwined with My Presence. Rejoice as we journey together in intimate communion. Enjoy the adventure of finding yourself through losing yourself in Me.
</p>

<p>
<i>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!</i> — 2 Corinthians 5:17
</p>

<p>
<i>For we are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.</i> — Ephesians 3:10
</p>

<p>
<i>Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.</i> — 1 John 4:7-8
</p>

<p>
<i>”Remain in me, and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.”</i> — John 15:4

<p>
The Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ
</p>

<p>
The Twenty-fifth Day of December,
</p>

<p>
when ages beyond number had run their course from the creation of the world,
</p>

<p>
when God in the beginning created heaven and earth, and formed man in his own likeness;
</p>

<p>
when century upon century had passed since the Almighty set his bow in the clouds after the Great Flood, as a sign of covenant and peace;
</p>

<p>
in the twenty-first century since Abraham, our father in faith, came out of Ur of the Chaldees;
</p>

<p>
in the thirteenth century since the People of Israel were led by Moses in the Exodus from Egypt;
</p>

<p>
around the thousandth year since David was anointed King;
</p>

<p>
in the sixty-fifth week of the prophecy of Daniel;
</p>

<p>
in the one hundred and ninety-fourth Olympiad;
</p>

<p>
in the year seven hundred and fifty-two since the foundation of the City of Rome;
</p>

<p>
in the forty-second year of the reign of Caesar Octavian Augustus, the whole world being at peace,
</p>

<p>
JESUS CHRIST, eternal God and Son of the eternal Father, desiring to consecrate the world by his most loving presence, was conceived by the Holy Spirit, and when nine months had passed since his conception, was born of the Virgin Mary in Bethlehem of Judah, and was made man:
</p>

<p>
The Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ according to the flesh.
