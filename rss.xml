  <title><![CDATA[The Friday Before Easter, Commonly Called Good Friday]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
ALMIGHTY God, we beseech thee graciously to behold this thy family, for which our Lord Jesus Christ was contented to be betrayed, and given up into the hands of wicked men, and to suffer death upon the cross; who now liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost ever, one God, world without end. <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, by whose Spirit the whole body of the Church is governed and sanctified; Receive our supplications and prayers, which we offer before thee for all estates of men in thy holy Church, that every member of the same, in his vocation and ministry, may truly and godly serve thee; through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
MERCIFUL God, who hast made all men, and hatest nothing that thou hast made, nor desirest the death of a sinner, but rather that he should be converted and live; Have mercy upon all who know thee not as thou art revealed in the Gospel of thy Son. Take from them all ignorance, hardness of heart, and contempt of thy Word; and so fetch them home, blessed Lord, to thy fold, that they may be made one flock under one shepherd, Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end. <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
The Proper Sentences for Good Friday are as follows:
</p>

<p>
Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow which is done unto me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me. <i>Lam. i. I 2</i>.
</p>

<p>
In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace. <i>Eph. i. 7</i>.

  <title><![CDATA[Anunciation of the BVM]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin&rsquo;s name was Mary.
</p>

<p>
And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.
</p>

<p>
And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.
</p>

<p>
And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.
</p>

<p>
And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.
</p>

<p>
He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
</p>

<p>
Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
</p>

<p>
And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.
</p>

<p>
For with God nothing shall be impossible.
</p>

<p>
And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

  <title><![CDATA[The Fourth Sunday in Lent, known as Mothering Sunday]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Grant, we beseech thee, Almighty God, that we, who for our evil deeds do worthily deserve to be punished, by the comfort of thy grace may mercifully be relieved; through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
The Fourth Sunday in Lent is known as “Refreshment Sunday” or “Mothering Sunday”. Vestments are rose colored this day.
</p>

<p>
“During the Middle Ages, it became a custom for British Christians to return to the parish in which they were baptized, their “mother church,” on Mothering Sunday. This highlights an ancient Christian emphasis on baptism as a new birth that is highlighted at the blessing of the font during the Easter Vigil service and is prominent in the baptismal rite itself.
</p>

<p>
“Beginning in the 15th century, Mothering Sunday became a time to focus on the importance of mothers. On this day, servants were often furloughed to go visit their mothers. Given the celebratory nature of the day, families would often make simnel cakes, a type of fruitcake, as they enjoyed each other’s company.
</p>

<p>
“Of special interest is the fact that Mothering Sunday falls around the Feast of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a day when we especially consider the significance of the Theotokos, the Mother of God.”
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Fr. Wesley Walker for comments on Mothering Sunday.

  <title><![CDATA[Spiritual Avarice]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Those with SPIRITUAL AVARICE will be found to be discontented with the spirituality which God gives them; and they are very disconsolate and querulous because they find not in spiritual things the consolation that they would desire.  They spend their time on [learning of spiritual matters] rather than on works of mortification and the perfecting of the inward poverty of spirit which should be theirs. They burden themselves with images and rosaries which are very curious&#x2026; they want this kind of thing, now that, because it is more curious. And others you will see adorned with relics and tokens, like children with trinkets.

  <title><![CDATA[Ash Wednesday Commination]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
A Commination or Denouncing of God’s Anger and Judgments Against Sinners
</p>

<p>
With certain prayers to be used on the first day of Lent, and at other times, as the Ordinary shall appoint.
</p>

<p>
<i>After Morning Prayer, the Litany ended, according to the accustomed manner, the Priest shall in the reading Pew or Pulpit say</i>,
</p>

<p>
BRETHREN, in the primitive Church there was a godly discipline, that, at the beginning of Lent, such persons as stood convicted of notorious sin were put to open penance, and punished in this world, that their souls might be saved in the day of the Lord; and that others, admonished by their example, might be the more afraid to offend.
</p>

<p>
Instead whereof, until the said discipline may be restored again, (which is much to be wished,) it is thought good that at this time (in the presence of you all) should be read the general sentences of God’s cursing against impenitent sinners, gathered out of the seven and twentieth chapter of Deuteronomy, and other places of Scripture; and that ye should answer to every sentence, Amen: To the intent that, being admonished of the great indignation of God against sinners, ye may the rather be moved to earnest and true repentance; and may walk more warily in these dangerous days; fleeing from such vices, for which ye affirm with your own mouths the curse of God to be due.
</p>

<p>
CURSED is the man that maketh any carved or molten image, to worship it.
</p>

<p>
<i>And the people shall answer and say</i>,
</p>

<p>
<i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
Minister: Cursed is he that curseth his father or mother.
</p>

<p>
Answer: <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
Minister: Cursed is he that removeth his neighbour’s land-mark.
</p>

<p>
Answer: <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
Minister: Cursed is he that maketh the blind to go out of his way.
</p>

<p>
Answer: <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
Minister: Cursed is he that perverteth the judgement of the stranger, the fatherless, and widow.
</p>

<p>
Answer: <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
Minister: Cursed is he that smiteth his neighbour secretly.
</p>

<p>
Answer: <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
Minister: Cursed is he that lieth with his neighbour’s wife.
</p>

<p>
Answer: <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
Minister: Cursed is he that taketh reward to slay the innocent.
</p>

<p>
Answer: <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
Minister: Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man, and taketh man for his defence, and in his heart goeth from the Lord.
</p>

<p>
Answer: <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
Minister: Cursed are the unmerciful, fornicators, and adulterers, covetous persons, idolaters, slanderers, drunkards, and extortioners.
</p>

<p>
Answer: <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Minister</i>:
</p>

<p>
NOW seeing that all they are accursed (as the prophet David beareth witness) who do err and go astray from the commandments of God; let us (remembering the dreadful judgement hanging over our heads, and always ready to fall upon us) return unto our Lord God with all contrition and meekness of heart; bewailing and lamenting our sinful life, acknowledging and confessing our offences, and seeking to bring forth worthy fruits of penance. For now is the axe put unto the root of the trees, so that every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God: He shall pour down rain upon the sinners, snares, fire and brimstone, storm and tempest; this shall be their portion to drink. For lo, the Lord is come out of his place to visit the wickedness of such as dwell upon the earth. But who may abide the day of his coming? Who shall be able to endure when he appeareth? His fan is in his hand, and he will purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the barn; but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire. The day of the Lord cometh as a thief in the night: and when men shall say, Peace, and all things are safe, then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as sorrow cometh upon a woman travailing with child, and they shall not escape. Then shall appear the wrath of God in the day of vengeance, which obstinate sinners, through the stubbornness of their heart, have heaped unto themselves; which despised the goodness, patience, and long-sufferance of God, when he calleth them continually to repentance. Then shall they call upon me (saith the Lord) but I will not hear; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me; and that, because they hated knowledge, and received not the fear of the Lord, but abhorred my counsel, and despised my correction. Then shall it be too late to knock, when the door shall be shut; and too late to cry for mercy, when it is the time of justice. O terrible voice of most just judgement, which shall be pronounced upon them, when it shall be said unto them, Go, ye cursed, into the fire everlasting, which is prepared for the devil and his angels. Therefore, brethren, take we heed betime, while the day of salvation lasteth; for the night cometh, when none can work: But let us, while we have the light, believe in the light, and walk as children of the light; that we be not cast into utter darkness, where is weeping and gnashing of teeth. Let us not abuse the goodness of God, who calleth us mercifully to amendment, and of his endless pity promiseth us forgiveness of that which is past, if with a perfect and true heart we return unto him. For though our sins be as red as scarlet, they shall be made white as snow; and though they be like purple, yet they shall be made white as wool. Turn ye (saith the Lord) from all your wickedness, and your sin shall not be your destruction: Cast away from you all your ungodliness that ye have done: Make you new hearts, and a new spirit: Wherefore will ye die, O ye house of Israel? seeing that I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God. Turn ye then, and ye shall live. Although we have sinned, yet have we an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and he is the propitiation for our sins. For he was wounded for our offences, and smitten for our wickedness. Let us therefore return unto him, who is the merciful receiver of all true penitent sinners; assuring ourselves that he is ready to receive us, and most willing to pardon us, if we come unto him with faithful repentance; if we submit ourselves unto him, and from henceforth walk in his ways; if we will take his easy yoke and light burden upon us, to follow him in lowliness, patience, and charity, and be ordered by the governance of his Holy Spirit; seeking always his glory, and serving him duly in our vocation with thanksgiving. This if we do, Christ will deliver us from the curse of the law, and from the extreme malediction which shall light upon them that shall be set on the left hand; and he will set us on his right hand, and give us the gracious benediction of his Father, commanding us to take possession of his glorious kingdom: Unto which he vouchsafe to bring us all, for his infinite mercy. <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Then shall they all kneel upon their knees, and the Priest and Clerks kneeling (in the place where they are accustomed to say the Litany) shall say this Psalm</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Miserere mei, Deus</i>. Psalm 51
</p>

<p>
HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness : according to the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.
</p>

<p>
Wash me throughly from my wickedness : and cleanse me from my sin.
</p>

<p>
For I acknowledge my faults : and my sin is ever before me.
</p>

<p>
Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight : that thou mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou art judged.
</p>

<p>
Behold, I was shapen in wickedness : and in sin hath my mother conceived me.
</p>

<p>
But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: and shalt make me to understand wisdom secretly.
</p>

<p>
Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean : thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
</p>

<p>
Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness: that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.
</p>

<p>
Turn thy face away from my sins : and put out all my misdeeds.
</p>

<p>
Make me a clean heart, O God : and renew a right spirit within me.
</p>

<p>
Cast me not away from thy presence : and take not thy holy Spirit from me.
</p>

<p>
O give me the comfort of thy help again : and stablish me with thy free Spirit.
</p>

<p>
Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked: and sinners shall be converted unto thee.
</p>

<p>
Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my health : and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.
</p>

<p>
Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord : and my mouth shall shew thy praise.
</p>

<p>
For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee : but thou delightest not in burnt-offering.
</p>

<p>
The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit : a broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt thou not despise.
</p>

<p>
O be favourable and gracious unto Sion : build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the burnt-offerings and oblations : then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine altar.
</p>

<p>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son : and to the Holy Ghost;
</p>

<p>
Answer: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be : world without end. <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
Lord, have mercy upon us.
</p>

<p>
<i>Christ, have mercy upon us</i>.
</p>

<p>
Lord, have mercy upon us.
</p>

<p>
OUR Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive them that trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
Minister: O Lord, save thy servants;
</p>

<p>
Answer: That put their trust in thee.
</p>

<p>
Minister: Send unto them help from above.
</p>

<p>
Answer: And evermore mightily defend them.
</p>

<p>
Minister: Help us, O God our Saviour.
</p>

<p>
Answer: And for the glory of thy Name deliver us; be merciful unto us sinners, for thy Name’s sake.
</p>

<p>
Minister: O Lord, hear our prayer.
</p>

<p>
Answer: And let our cry come unto thee.
</p>

<p>
Minister: Let us pray.
</p>

<p>
O LORD, we beseech thee, mercifully hear our prayers, and spare all those who confess their sins unto thee; that they, whose consciences by sin are accused, by thy merciful pardon may be absolved; through Christ our Lord. <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
O MOST mighty God, and merciful Father, who hast compassion upon all men, and hatest nothing that thou hast made; who wouldest not the death of a sinner, but that he should rather turn from his sin, and be saved: Mercifully forgive us our trespasses; receive and comfort us, who are grieved and wearied with the burden of our sins. Thy property is always to have mercy; to thee only it appertaineth to forgive sins. Spare us therefore, good Lord, spare thy people, whom thou hast redeemed; enter not into judgement with thy servants, who are vile earth, and miserable sinners; but so turn thine anger from us, who meekly acknowledge our vileness, and truly repent us of our faults, and so make haste to help us in this world, that we may ever live with thee in the world to come; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Then shall the people say this that followeth, after the Minister</i>.
</p>

<p>
TURN thou us, O good Lord, and so shall we be turned. Be favourable, O Lord, Be favourable to thy people, Who turn to thee in weeping, fasting, and praying. For thou art a merciful God, Full of compassion, long-suffering, and of great pity. Thou sparest when we deserve punishment, And in thy wrath thinkest upon mercy. Spare thy people, good Lord, Spare them, and let not thine heritage be brought to confusion. Hear us, O Lord, for thy mercy is great, And after the multitude of thy mercies look upon us; Through the merits and mediation of thy blessed Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Then the Minister alone shall say</i>,
</p>

<p>
THE Lord bless us, and keep us; the Lord lift up the light of his countenance upon us, and give us peace, now and for evermore. <i>Amen</i>.

  <title><![CDATA[A Particular Old Laptop]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
A few days ago I wrote about a) being intrigued by Derek Sivers’ decision to stick with his old (2013) ThinkPad t440s, and b) my self-imposed obligation to try to make my collection of old laptops (the 2001 IBM ThinkPad R32 and 2011 MacBook Pro and HP Elitebook) work well enough to cool my desire for yet another ThinkPad. Well, I’ve been busy.
</p>

<p>
The MacBook Pro (13” mid-2011) has served me well as a platform that can run Microsoft Office and high-end scanner tools without being (gag) Windows. However, it’s gradually gotten to just not work quite right. I tried the standard thing — reinstalling the OS — which gave me a live Mac which still didn’t work quite right. At that point I got a Cunning Plan — restore from a backup long enough ago that it was still working right. I chose June 30, 2022 out of thin air and did the deed. It took ages, but resulted in a system that came really close to being OK. The trackpad is still Not Quite Right, but I can use the Mac without a mouse now.
</p>

<p>
The HP went through a similar if somewhat different process. It was running Ubuntu, which I’ve grown over the years to dislike, so the first step was to install Debian. Sounds easy, doesn’t it? I tried installing with a Debian 11 install CD that I’d used on my workstation some months ago, which went as far as installing drivers and locked-up. Old CD, must be scratched. Download the installer, burn a new CD, try again, freeze at the same place. So maybe try a thumb drive. Got it installed, but no WiFi, not a good thing for a laptop. Plus the battery is 100% dead. So I ordered another battery from Amazon and researched the WiFi issue. Seemed to be a firmware issue that can be easily resolved by using an install .iso that includes non-free files. So I downloaded and burned a new thumb drive, and now the WiFi works. And, it’s still not a ThinkPad. The keyboard isn’t better than OK, it has a trackpoint but it doesn’t feel right, and it’s overall angular and a bit heavy. Or am I just working on convincing myself that I Really Need a ThinkPad? I guess so.
</p>

<p>
I’ve been scanning Amazon and eBay for t440-460s (and that’s “s” for plural), preferably “refurbished” with some guarantee over and above a 30-day return policy. Found a dealer who offers a 30-day free return and 1 year guarantee on its refurbished ex-lease ThinkPads. Looked long and hard at a t440 with 8Mb RAM and a 500GB HDD for $166 — $176 with tax, then Did the Deed, using PayPal Credit for its 6-month zero interest. Should have it by Thursday or Friday, they say. Will be typing with fingers crossed between now and then. It will come with Windows 10 Pro installed, which I am likely to leave when I add Debian 11.

<p>
O Lord, who hast taught us that all our doings without charity are nothing worth; Send thy Holy Ghost, and pour into our hearts that most excellent gift of charity, the very bond of peace and of all virtues, without which whosoever liveth is counted dead before thee. Grant this for thine only Son Jesus Christ’s sake. <i>Amen</i>.

  <title><![CDATA[About Old Laptops]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Last week my rss feed brought me a post by ‘Solene’%’ about <a href="https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2022-06-22-openbsd-selling-arguments.html">”How I would sell OpenBSD as a salesperson”</a>. I’m always interested in seeing what other geeks, particularly writers, use for hardware and software, and I’ve been more than mildly interested in moving out of Linux back into a “real” UNIX eventually, which these days means one of the BSDs (FreeBSD, OpenBSD or NetBSD). And so I have a “BSDs” folder in Instapaper and there found links to several pages on Derek Sivers’ site that mention OpenBSD (stay with me, there is a point to these wanderings). The one that caught my eye most was <a href="https://sive.rs/uses">What I Use</a>.
</p>

<p>
I relate to Sivers’ approach to tools a lot, since he seems to buy good stuff and then keep it forever, although he’s quite well off and guided by a philosophical preference for buying and owning as little as possible, while I just insist that I’m much poorer than I really am. Parsing his list of hardware, his workstation is a “Silent Desktop PC” is top quality from 2014 (mine is about the same age based on parts from a server that hosted my last project ten years ago). We’re sort of on a par there.
</p>

<p>
His next entry is his laptop, a Lenovo ThinkPad T440s dating from 2013. That caught my eye. I have a stack of old laptops: two from 2011, an 11” Apple MacBook Pro and a 14” HP Elitebook 8460p, and a 14” 2001 IBM ThinkPad R32. They all work, and they all have issues when it comes to acting like a laptop (that is, allowing me to use Emacs away from my desk). For one thing, they all have battery issues. The HP and the IBM batteries are completely dead, and the Mac’s is very weak. New batteries can be had easily enough, although in Apple style replacing the Mac battery would mean getting out my soldering gun.
</p>

<p>
I’ve never gotten completely comfortable with the Mac. It’s nice hardware—the case is wonderful and the keyboard is acceptable. It’s the software—and mainly MacOS—that I’ve never gotten completely accustomed to. It’s close enough to UNIX/Linux that I can do most of what I want to do, but then it throws a curve into the works that sends me to search for “the Mac way” to finish a job. And by now the trackpad is acting strange and I’m using a mouse when I need to use it (scanning and Kindle/Calibre are really the only things I use it for these days). I need to take some time off and see whether I can get the trackpad working right again.
</p>

<p>
The HP is OK. It’s pretty loud, a little heavy, the keyboard is kinda clunky. It’s running Ubuntu now, which worked for Valerie when it was her “desktop” but isn’t my cuppa tea. Perhaps with a working battery and a proper Debian installation it could be useful.
</p>

<p>
That twenty-year-old IBM ThinkPad really is my idea of a laptop I could live with, if it had a newer processor, batteries, wifi and was a little lighter. It might be just that I used ThinkPads during my stay at Northrop Grumman, but it has hands-down the best small keyboard, and the track-stick Just Works. That’s why Sivers’ ThinkPad T440s got my attention. It didn’t take long to learn that they are readily available on eBay an Amazon for $250 or less.
</p>

<p>
So, tempted as I am to just pick one and order it, I feel honor bound to see what I can do to get the MacBook and the HP running right and see whether I can “make do” first.
</p>

<p>
Stay tuned. I’ve been busy already.

O Lord God, who seest that we put not our trust in any thing that we do; Mercifully grant that by thy power we may be defended against all adversity; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

  <title><![CDATA[Nine Days of Prayer for one Deceased — Day Nine]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
For my late brother-in-law, Dr. Dean Presnall
</p>

<p>
V. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil.
</p>

<p>
R. I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
</p>

<p>
V. Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.
</p>

<p>
R. I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
</p>

<p>
V. Rest eternal grant to them, O Lord;
</p>

<p>
R. And let light perpetual shine upon them.
</p>

<p>
I GIVE YOU THANKS, O Lord, that you have created us to know and love you, and to live with each other in joyful companionship. In grief, strengthen my hope, and in sorrow, keep me from despair. Grant that Dean may go from strength to strength in the life of perfect service, and that I may so serve you here, that at the last, by your call, I will stand before you and with those whom I have loved but see no longer; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
OUR Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercies of God, rest in peace. <i>Amen</i>

O LORD, OUR SAVIOR AND OUR JUDGE, by your passion and through your never failing mercies, grant forgiveness to Dean for all his sins, and rest from all the burdens he has carried; and by your Spirit, bring us all to acknowledge our sins that we may seek your forgiveness and make us patient and joyful to forgive one another for your sake; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <i>Amen</i>.
