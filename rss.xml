  <title><![CDATA[St James Apostle and Martyr]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
GRANT, O merciful God, that, as thine holy Apostle Saint James, leaving his father and all that he had, without delay was obedient unto the calling of thy Son Jesus Christ, and followed him; so we, forsaking all worldly and carnal affections, may be evermore ready to follow thy holy commandments; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. <i>Amen</i>.

<p>
“Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church. And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.”—Acts 12:1-2
</p>

<p>
St. James, from Bethsaida, is called “the Greater” because his vocation to serve Christ preceded that of the other apostle of the same name. He was the son of Zebedee and the brother of John. He was one of the three disciples to witness the Transfiguration (Mt 17:1) and the agony in the Garden (Mt 26:37), aside from other important events of our Saviour’s public life. He and his brother’s impetuous zeal caused the Lord to name them the Sons of Thunder.
</p>

<p>
James developed his apostolate in Judaea and Samaria. According to tradition he preached the Gospel in Spain. On his return to Palestine about the year 44, he became the first Apostle to suffer martyrdom, at the order of Herod Agrippa. His mortal remains were later brought to Santiago de Compostela, in Spain, which became a popular medieval pilgrimage site and a sanctuary of the Faith for all of Europe

  <title><![CDATA[St Vincent of Lèrins]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
O GOD, who didst raise up thy blessed Confessor Vincent to proclaim the rule of faith; grant that all thy people may steadfastly witness to the fullness of Catholic truths, that the same may be received everywhere, always, and by all, even as thou has taught us. Through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
The Season is Ascensiontide, the Liturgical Color is White.
</p>

<p>
Saint Vincent of Lérins, pseudonym Peregrinus, (born, possibly Toul, Belgica [now in France]—died c. 450; feast day May 24), Gallo-Roman saint, the chief theologian of the Abbey of Lérins, known especially for his heresiography Commonitoria (“Memoranda”).
</p>

<p>
Early in the treatise he established his oft-quoted and influential principle on tradition as the test of orthodoxy—the true Catholic faith is that which has been “believed everywhere, always and by all.” This has been quoted often in support of Anglicanism’s claim to be a <i>via media</i>. Listen to Vincent’s voice on the subject:
</p>

<p>
“I have often earnestly inquired of many holy and learned men how and by what sure and universal rule I may distinguish the truth of the Catholic faith from the falsehood of heresy. In almost every instance I have received this answer: All who wish to detect the frauds of heretics and to stay rooted in the Catholic faith must, with the Lord’s help, fortify their own belief in two ways: first by the authority of Scripture, and then, by the tradition of the Catholic Church.
</p>

<p>
“Since the canon of Scripture is complete and more than sufficient of itself for everything, you might ask what need is there to join with it the authority of the church’s interpretation. For this reason: Because owing to the depth of holy Scripture, all do not accept it in one and the same sense. But one understands its words in one way, another differently, so that the Bible seems to be capable of as many interpretations as there are interpreters. Thus it is very necessary that the rule for the right understanding of the prophets and apostles should be framed in accordance with the standard ecclesiastical and Catholic interpretation.
</p>

<p>
“ <i>Moreover, in the Catholic Church itself, all possible care must be taken that we hold that faith which has been believed everywhere, always and by all.</i> This rule we shall observe if we follow universality, antiquity and consent. We follow universality if we confess that one faith as true that the whole church throughout the world confesses. Antiquity, if we never depart from those interpretations manifestly held by our holy ancestors and fathers. Consent, if in antiquity itself, we adhere to the definitions and determinations held by all, or at least by almost all priests and teachers.”

  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
GRANT, we beseech thee, Almighty God, that like as we do believe thy only-begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ to have ascended into the heavens; so we may also in heart and mind thither ascend, and with him continually dwell, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, one God, world without end. <i>Amen</i>.

<p>
And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And ye are witnesses of these things. And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven. And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.— <i>St Luke 24:44</i>

  <title><![CDATA[The Fifth Sunday After Easter, Commonly Called Rogation Sunday]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
O Lord, from whom all good things do come; Grant to us thy humble servants, that by thy holy inspiration we may think those things that are good, and by thy merciful guiding may perform the same; through our Lord Jesus Christ. <i>Amen</i>.
</p>

<p>
The Season is Eastertide, the Liturgical Color is White.
</p>

<p>
“Rogation” comes from the Latin verb <i>rogare</i>, meaning “to ask”. There are two phases of Rogation Days, the “major” on 25 April, and the “minor”, Monday through Wednesday before Ascension Thursday.
</p>

<p>
On Rogation Days, with fasting, processions and the singing of the Litany of Saints, we ask God to protect us from danger. One danger in the ancient world was crop failure. Indeed, our Christian Rogation Days tradition stems from the pagan Roman practice of the Robigalia procession on 25 April with, among other weird things, the sacrifice of a dog to the god (really a demon) Robigus against wheat rust, a disease that attacked that precious crop. By the 5th century here and there in France, Christians had replaced all the pagan stuff with goodly uses. The practice spread in a wholesome way as wholesome practices did. Pope Leo III (+816) incorporated the Rogation Days into the Roman Rite. So, we’ve had them for well over a thousand years, give or take a century.
