<p>
And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin&rsquo;s name was Mary.
</p>

<p>
And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.
</p>

<p>
And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.
</p>

<p>
And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.
</p>

<p>
And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.
</p>

<p>
He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
</p>

<p>
Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
</p>

<p>
And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.
</p>

<p>
For with God nothing shall be impossible.
</p>

<p>
And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.
</p>

<p>
The Season is Lent, the Liturgical Color is Purple.
